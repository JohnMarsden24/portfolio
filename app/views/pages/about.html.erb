      <p class="mb30 intro">
        After a decade of programming machines and robots for the architectural and engineering manufacturing sectors, I grew curious as to other forms of coding. So at the start of this year I attended a full stack web
        development bootcamp at Le Wagon London to learn how to code.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now armed with an extensive understanding of web development using frameworks and having a problem solving yet creative and innovative mindset, I am able to deliver elegant and user-centric solutions effectively and efficiently.
